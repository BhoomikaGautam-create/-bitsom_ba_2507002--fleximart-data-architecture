Section A: Limitations of RDBMS
Relational databases rely on rigid, predefined schemas, which makes them unsuitable for product catalogs with diverse attributes. For instance, laptops require specifications such as RAM and processor, while shoes depend on size and color. Representing these variations in a single relational table often leads to numerous nullable fields or separate tables, creating inefficiency and complexity. Additionally, frequent schema changes—such as introducing new product categories—necessitate altering table structures, which is time‑consuming, disruptive, and prone to errors. This rigidity slows down system adaptability and complicates maintenance. Finally, customer reviews typically contain nested data, including ratings, comments, and replies. In an RDBMS, such hierarchical information must be decomposed into multiple linked tables, requiring complex joins to reconstruct the original structure. This approach reduces query performance and makes data retrieval cumbersome. Overall, relational databases struggle with flexibility, scalability, and usability when faced with heterogeneous and nested datasets.

Section B: NoSQL Benefits
MongoDB addresses the limitations of relational databases by offering a flexible, document‑oriented schema. Instead of rigid tables, data is stored in JSON‑like documents, allowing each product to have attributes tailored to its category. For example, laptops can include RAM and processor fields, while shoes can store size and color, without forcing unnecessary null values or schema redesigns. This flexibility supports rapid innovation and seamless addition of new product types. Furthermore, MongoDB enables embedded documents, meaning customer reviews can be stored directly within product records. Ratings, comments, and replies remain nested inside the product document, simplifying queries and eliminating complex joins. This structure improves performance and makes data retrieval more intuitive. Finally, MongoDB’s horizontal scalability allows data to be distributed across multiple servers through sharding. As Fleximart’s dataset grows, the system can scale out efficiently, ensuring high availability, faster response times, and cost‑effective handling of large, diverse workloads.

Section C: Trade‑offs
While MongoDB offers flexibility and scalability, it also presents certain disadvantages compared to MySQL. First, MongoDB does not provide the same level of strict ACID compliance as relational databases, which can be a drawback for applications requiring strong transactional consistency. Complex multi‑document transactions may be harder to implement and less efficient. Second, MongoDB’s document‑oriented model can lead to increased storage requirements and potential duplication of data, since embedded documents replicate information rather than normalizing it. This can complicate maintenance and increase costs. Thus, MongoDB trades simplicity and scalability for reduced consistency and efficiency in some scenarios.
